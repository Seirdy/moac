# rationale for choosing Fedora or Arch for CI:
# - up-to-date packages for clang
# - compiler-rt is complete; contains CFI, msan, tsan sanitizers
# - already plan to save Debian Sid for testing on ARM
# Between Arch and Fedora, I chose Fedora bc I like to test stuff in Rawhide
# on my workstation
image: fedora/35
packages:
  - alternatives
  - clang
  - curl
  - compiler-rt
  - git  # for go and versioning
  - lld
  - make
  - scdoc
  - tar
environment:
  PATH: /usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
  MAKEFLAGS: --no-print-directory
  # fewer loops since we're running sanitizers, which slow things down.
  # run more loops in the openbsd manifest since that doesn't use sanitizers
